# PyBer Analysis Report





# Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to extrapolate information regarding the differences between PyBer fares and rides in urban, suburban, and rural areas.

# Results

After generating the multiple line chart, we can conclude that generally, there are far less rides in rural areas compared to urban and suburban regions.

Rides that took place in urban areas are more frequent, having more fares than the rest of the regions 

It looks like between the months of Feb and Mar, there is a spike in fares in all regions, one can speculate maybe a cause of this spike could be a holiday. 


# Summary
Overall, it seems like there are more fares in urban areas, possibly because of the proximity and larger population. I suggest the company continue focusing efforts in having more vehicles and an emphasis is urban regions. Urban areas total 1625 rides, more than double suburban areas and more than twelve times rural locations 

Suburban fares spike up towards the end of April, it would be wise to continue serving these areas while possibly increase fare costs.
Due to the low total  fares in Rural regions, it can be suggested that the company slightly increase fare costs due cover travel costs for drivers. Rural locations due have a higher average cost per ride at $34, compared to suburban at $31, and urban at $25.  It seems that it is much easier to make profit in urban areas than rural locations.
